Product: Integration tests for WSO2 ESB SMPP connector

Pre-requisites:

 - Maven 3.x
 - Java 1.7
 - The org.wso2.esb.integration.integration-base project is required. The test suite has been configured to download this project automatically.
   If the automatic download fails, download the following project and compile it using the mvn clean install command to update your local repository:
   https://github.com/wso2-extensions/esb-integration-base

Tested Platform: 

 - UBUNTU 16.04
 - WSO2 ESB 5.0.0


STEPS:

 1.Download ESB 5.0.0 from official website and extract the ESB and add "-XX:-UseSplitVerifier" under $JVM_MEM_OPTS into {ESB_HOME}/bin/wso2server.sh.

 2. Compress modified ESB and copy that zip file in to location "{SMPP_CONNECTOR_HOME}/repository/".

 3. Before start the ESB, download jsmpp-2.1.0-RELEASE.jar copy inside the {ESB_HOME}/repository/components/lib

 4. Integration test written based on SMSC simulator. To do that download simulator from https://github.com/smn/logica-smpp-sim

 5. Go to SMSC Simulator directory, edit the users.txt file and add following name-value pairs to it.

   name="your username"
   password="your password"
   timeout=unlimited

 6. Go to "{SMPP_HOME}/src/test/resources/artifacts/ESB/connector/config/SMPP.properties" and edit your host, port, username, password.

 7. Start SMSC Simulator by executing the following command, "java -cp smpp.jar:smscsim.jar com.logica.smscsim.Simulator".

 8. You will see a simulator screen. There,
                Enter 1 for the prompt to start simulation.
                Enter port number as you provided in the SMPP.properties.
                You will see the “Starting listener... started.” log on the console.
